/**
 * Guest-to-customer conversion on mobile (Guest Browsing §7, §21, §28, §29).
 *
 * A guest browses the whole app. The moment they reach for something that
 * belongs to an account - saving, following, claiming, booking - this raises a
 * bottom sheet over the screen they are on rather than throwing them into a
 * login stack. Dismissing it returns them to exactly what they were doing.
 *
 * `resume` is the §7 requirement that is easy to miss: after signing in, the
 * action the guest started must complete on its own.
 *
 *   Guest taps Save -> sheet -> login -> offer saved, no second tap
 *
 * The closure is held in a ref rather than in state so that replaying it does
 * not depend on a render happening first, and so a stale intent cannot survive
 * into the next session.
