/**
 * Where the app talks to the API.
 *
 * `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` variables are inlined into the bundle at build time, so this
 * is decided when the binary is built and cannot be changed afterwards. That
 * is what makes getting it wrong expensive: a release built without it is not
 * misconfigured, it is inert, and every screen fails in a way that looks like
 * the server is down.
 *
 * Where each build gets its value:
 *
 *   development  .env in this directory (gitignored). A phone resolves
 *                "localhost" to itself, so on a real device this must be the
 *                dev machine's LAN address, e.g. http://192.168.1.20:3000/api
 *   preview      eas.json -> build.preview.env
 *   production   eas.json -> build.production.env
 *
 * `.env` is gitignored and EAS builds from git, so a cloud build never sees it.
 * That is why the two shipping profiles name the URL in `eas.json` instead:
 * committed, reviewable, and the same for everyone who runs the build.
